predicting-heart-disease-with-machine-learning using KNN
As a data scientist working for a healthcare solutions company, your goal is to analyze patient data and build a model that can help identify individuals at risk for heart disease. This project combines data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and model buildingâ€”all valuable skills for aspiring data professionals.

 we'll have built a machine learning model that can predict heart disease with over 80% accuracy, and you'll understand each step of the machine learning workflow from start to finish.
